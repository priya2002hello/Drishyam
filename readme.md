<h1>DRISHYAM</h1>
<h3>Record, Register & Verify !!! </h3>

Drishyam ( VISUALS ) , is  a Criminal Background Check Web application made for Police forces .

Police Clearance is a must requirement for recruitment in gov jobs. It is also issued to Indian passport holders when they apply for employment, residential status, long term visa, or immigration. 


<h3>Conventionally, applicants have to follow given steps to get police clearence</h3>

  •	Visit your nearest police station.

  •	Answer the queries of a police officer. They usually conduct a background check and enquire about the purpose of the application.

  •	The authorities will scrutinise the documents and decide whether to give Police Clearance Certificate or not.


<h3>This process has following cons</h3>

  •	It is time consuming

  •	accuracy and efficiency depends on how police authorities conduct background check. With the increase in rate of crime and no. of criminals as well, it becomes       difficult to perform background check of a single person .

<hr>
Drishyam Solves these problems with the use of Face Recognition Technology.
It provides three main  Services to police department :-

<h3>	View & Verify Police Clearance Applications</h3> 
 Candidate details can be viewed at first place. Then a background check is performed. The candidate has to sit before camera & the  application tells within few seconds if the candidate has a criminal record or not.
Thus, saves a lot of time and also makes the process quite easier.  Also, the results do not dependend on how police authorities conduct a background check
